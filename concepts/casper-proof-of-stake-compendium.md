## Casper FFG

[Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget (FFG)](https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/papers/casper-basics), AKA for short as Casper FFG, for PoS validation with Proof-of-Work (PoW). Resources include:

-   [EIP 1011](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1011)
-   [implementation doc](https://github.com/ethereum/casper/blob/master/IMPLEMENTATION.md); and

## Casper CBC

[Casper the Friendly GHOST: Correct by Construction (CBC)](https://github.com/ethereum/research/blob/master/papers/CasperTFG/CasperTFG.pdf), AKA Casper CBC; for full Proof-of-Stake (PoS). [GHOST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881) stands for Greediest Heaviest Observed Sub-Tree, and is a blockchain fork-choice rule protocol. PoS will be essential for the sustainability of Ethereum, drastically reducing its energy consumption while increasing scalability and performance. Resources include:
