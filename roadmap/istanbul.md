The [Etherum 1.x](/eth1/eth1.md) page is a good starting point for an overview of Working Groups and areas of focus.

# Philosophy

Regular small hard forks allow upgrades to be included in more timely and manageable way that large infrequent forks, as described [here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/more-frequent-smaller-hardforks-vs-less-frequent-larger-ones/2929/28) 

**Istanbul** was approached with a *fork-centric* approach, where EIPs were proposed for the fork, reviewed then accepted. This resulted in many EIPs being proposed, in various states of readiness. This approach limits the amount of review time per EIP. 

 
**Future forks** will ideally follow an *EIP-centric* approach outlined [here](https://notes.ethereum.org/@holiman/S1ELAYY7S?type=view). This approach will allow EIPs to mature independently of forking schedule. When mature, they can be added to the next scheduled fork.

1. Endorsement (by major clients, developers and community stakeholders)
2. Implementation (merged into major clients)
3. Testing
4. Acceptance (Allocate to a specific hard fork)

# TL;DR


Istanbul brings upgrades that will:
- Align the costs of opcodes with their computational costs and improve denial-of-service attack resilience
- Make layer 2 solutions based on SNARKs and STARKs more performant.
- Enable Ethereum and Zcash to interoperate
- Allow contracts to introduce more creative functions.

Specifically:

**[EIP-152](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2129)** Adds the ability to verify the Equihash PoW within an ethereum contract. This will enable a relay and atomic-swap transactions between Zcash.

**[EIP-1108](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1108)** Makes zk-SNARKs cheaper, allowing for cheaper scaling and privacy applications to be built. See Matter labs, Aztec, Rollup and Zether for examples.

**[EIP-1344](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1344)** Adds a way for contracts to track the correct chain. To be used by contracts, especially those used by layer 2 (state channels, plasma), to follow the correct layer 1 chain, especially during a hard fork.

**[EIP-1884](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884)** Changes the cost of some EVM opcodes to prevent spamming attacks and to balance blocks better. The amount that must be paid for each operation in ethereum usually matches the computation required for that operation. This change increases some costs of some opcodes that are computationally intensive but currently cheap.

**[EIP-2028](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2028)** Makes zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs cheaper by reducing the cost of calling data within transactions. This will make layer 2 solutions able to increase throughput.

**[EIP-2200](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2200)** Changes the calculation of cost of storage in the EVM and will enable contracts to introduce new functions including re-entry locks and same-contract multi-send.

### Road to Istanbul in-brief
1. EIPs were considered
    - EIPs were discussed in All Core Devs calls, with priority given when an author was in attendance for a call.
    - EIPs were split into clusters by scope to facilitate discussion
    - Discussions in the Ethereum Magicians forum, AllCoreDevs gitter
2. The EIPs were reviewed and ultimately classified as:
    - Desired and ready to go into a fork. These were 'accepted'
    - Desired but not ready to go into a fork. These were 'tentatively accepted' with the intention of including them in the fork-after-istanbul (Berlin fork, see below)
    - Not desired due to fundamental issues including being withdrawn by the author. These were rejected indefinitely.
3. Implementations and testing finalised
4. Ropsten testnet fork planned to give one month between testnet and mainnet forks.
5. Mainnet fork planned
6. The 'tentatively accepted' EIPs to be included in the next fork (Berlin fork)

### Analysis of themes discussed versus included

Below are some themes that were among the discussed potential changes.

- State rent: Desired but not ready fo Istanbul
- EVM stack operation overhaul (EIP-615): Desired in theory, but complexity, implications for tooling and timeframe overwhelming. Withdrawn by author after a multi-year period of consideration. A similar EIP may be proposed in the future by other authors. An EVM stack call optimisation is on the proposed list for the Berlin fork.
- Account versioning: Initially highly favoured, largely because it was required for EIP-615. Then without a specific use case in mind it was thought that if needed a tailored solution should be implemented to ensure functionality is as desired. While still on the list for Berlin, it is up for discussion as to whether it will go ahead.
- Elliptic curves: Some specific curves implemented, with more general curve solutions still desired by community and left to be polished for the Berlin fork.
- Proof Of Work change: After long community discussion, a proof of work change will go ahead once auditing is complete and any issues rectified.
- Gas calculation granularity: Creating a system that will enable more precise gas costing is on the list proposed changes for the Berlin fork.

Some EIPs are complementary and some are mutually exclusive improvements that deprecate other proprosals. Below is a rough clustering to highlight these relationships. 


### Focused Co-ordination Discussions

To reduce the load on discussing each EIP independently in the dev calls, some EIP coordination happened in AllCoreDevs gitter [here](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs) during the first week of June 2019.

The clusters (expanded below) were:
- Elliptic curve cluster
- Account versioning cluster
- Chain metadata cluster
- Storage gas cost cluster
- Storage writing cluster
- Independent / not clustered

### **Elliptic curve cluster**


#### Key benefits: 
Scaling, privacy, bridges to other chains, DNS certificate validation in ENS, forward compatibility with IPFS.

Curves enabled and possible uses:
- The alt_bn128 curve (cheaper with 1108).
- Edwards curves (Weierstrass form) in general (cheaper with 1829). This covers curves of the naming convention 'Ed-'.
- Ed25519 is specifically enabled by 665.
- [LibSNARK](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/tree/f7c87b88744ecfd008126d415494d9b34c4c1b20) which uses edwards 'ed-', bn128 or alt_bn128 curves. Edwards curves are made cheaper with 1829. The alt_bn128 curve is are made cheaper with 1108.
- Aztec (made cheaper with 1108) which uses [alt_bn128](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/AZTEC)
- Private ERC20/721 transactions on ethereum mainnet with Nightfall (public domain code made by EY) (made cheaper with 1108) using [alt_bn128](https://github.com/EYBlockchain/nightfall/issues/14)
- [Matter labs](https://github.com/matter-labs/matter-network) scaling solution uses Alt_bn128
- [Roll up](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/roll_up) (made cheaper with 1829), a layer 2 scaling solution which uses the baby jubjub library with the [EdDSA curve](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub)

#### Key concepts and EIP interactions

**Introduce new curves using elliptic curve arithmetic with either 1962 (preferred) or 1829**

Both 1829 and 1962 allow for new curves to be added later without waiting for specific precomiples to be included in hard forks. 1829 Allows a class of eliptic curves (Edward curves) to be supported through a precompile for linear combinations. 1962 is a precompile that extends and formalises 1829. 1962 features (as compared to 1829) three main differences:
- Operation on arbitrary-length modulus (up to some upper-limit) for a base field and scalar field of the curve
- Pairing operations are introduced
- Different ABI due to variable parameter length

There were [no supporting arguments in a recent discussion](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf52f58ff3f016baa9a64c7) for 1829, and 1962 is progressing well, so 1829 will not be needed. 1962 requires either 1109 or 2046 to make calls economically viable (see below).

**How to define a precompile? (address range with 1352 vs client-based lists of known precompiles)**

1352 is still a **maybe** and the decision of "how do we define what a preompile is" is up for discussion. While it creates a nice range for defining what precompiles are, which [may help](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf543c5702b7e5e7621ed0f) with static analysis, there are some serious [concerns on FEM](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1352-restricted-address-range-for-precompiles-system-contracts/1151/26) about safety. It was clarified that 1352 is not required explicitly by either 1109 or 2046, so either of those can be chosen, but they may need to be modified to be clear about how the define a precompile. **Action required**: Decide if precompiles should be defined by range (push forward with 1352) or client based [lists](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf53cd06f530d3b612d9c96) (shelve 1352).

**Make precompile call costs cheaper, either by modifying an existing opcode (2046) or introducing a new opcode (1109)**

The goal is to make precompiles cheaper. Both EIPs seek to make 1108, 2024 and 1962 cheaper by reducing the cost of calling a precompile. The decision of 1109 vs 2046 was **undecided**. The [options](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf53d0bfaac6439343331a3) for calling precompiles are either to create a new opcode (choose 1109) or to modify the semantics of STATICCALL if the destination is a precomile. **Action required**: Decide if we prefer a new opcode or to modify an old opcode.

**Specific curve optimisations:**

There is a lot of interest in enabling immediate use of specific curves. Alt_bn128 is enabled by 1108. 1108 also supplements 1829 which reduces the cost of addition, multiplication and and pairing checks. 

Blake2b is enabled by 2024 which introduces a specific precompile for Blake2b for immediate use. Both 1108 and 2024 can coexist with 1962 [without issue](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf4d34a6fc5846bab533deb)

In ACD call 63 (45min41s), James Preswitch outlined that 2024 is superceded by a new [implementation](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2129) with F-compression, with smaller codebase changes, with less work required by client teams. Maintained by Keep, who have implemented in Geth. It is faster than the dedicated Blake2b 2024. The 2s curve could be a nice-to-have, for future ZCash-Ethereum interop, but at the moment has no implementation and maybe could go in the April 2020 hard fork. 

**DOS attack mitigation**

There was a [discussion](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1109-remove-call-costs-for-precompiled-contracts/447/8) about DOS attacks from calls that result in disk loading being too cheap. It seems that as long as the opcode being made cheaper only applies to precompiles, then [there is no risk](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1109-remove-call-costs-for-precompiled-contracts/447/9). 

1930 Adds the ability to make calls with specific amounts of gas, with a revert endpoint, through new variants of STATICCALL, DELEGATECALL and CALL. This [may benefit EIPs](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf576215de053468b08b9b8) that modify CALL/STATICCALL behaviour. The winner out of 1109 vs 2046 will need to be checked against 1930 to ensure behaviour is as expected.  

#### Elliptic Curve Cluster Outcome
- Prepare for Istanbul: 152 and 1108.
- Prepare for Berlin: 1962 and 2046.
- Shelve indefinitely: 1109, 1829 and 2024.


### **Storage writing cluster**


#### Key benefits:
- 1283 allows multiple write operation within a single call frame, allowing re-entry locks and multi-sends which are important for synchronus cross-dapp interactions..

#### Relevant EIPs:
- [1283 Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283) (Wei Tang). Clients already have implementations. The spec has been reviewed by many people. Previously had a re-entrancy bug [caused by contracts assuming long term stability of gas costs](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/immutables-invariants-and-upgradability/2440) which is now addressed with either **account versioning** or with 1706. There have been in-depth about choices of different net gas metering options (EIP-1087, EIP-1153, EIP-1283).
- [2200](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2200) Rebalance net-metered SSTORE gas cost with consideration of SLOAD gas cost change. This EIP is an updated version of 1283.
- [1706 Disable SSTORE with gasleft lower than call stipend](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1706) (Alex Forshtat, Yoav Weiss). 1706 is a required for 1832 to be compatible with many existing contracts if no account versioning is implemented.

#### Key concepts:
- Net gas metering is a [desired](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cfa29c1cea8295279090c00) feature. This can be provided with 1283 in a timely fashion without depending on the State Rent EIPs, with or without the use of account versioning.
- Net gas metering significantly reduces the gas cost for mutex and multi-step token transfers, which are necessary for synchronous cross dapp interactions. Benefits include improving [uniswap](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cfa77c8481ef4167be72d39).
- Even if account versioning goes ahead and 1706 is not explicitly required, it is simple to implement and would avoid future issues with repricing as noted [here](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cfa2cb465392c3b60d43ba6).
- Net gas metering would [not interfere](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cfa29c1cea8295279090c00) with State Rent EIPs, or complicate their designs. First, net gas metering can be implemented with account versioning. Second, even if net gas metering is implemented without account versioning, it can be easily toggled on or off many times on-chain without hugely affecting existing contracts. Given 1283 is strongly desired, implementing it even if metering is planned for State Rent seems preferred.
- It can be [beneficial](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cfa2e6a702b7e5e76439672) to implement net gas metering without account versioning, because existing contracts can also receive gas reduction.

#### Key decisions:
- Are there any opposed to implementing 1706 even if not explicitly required by 1283 (that is, if account versioning goes ahead)? If no, people need to review the 1706 [implementation](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum#10191) (the original fix for 1283).


#### Storage Writing Cluster Outcome
- Prepare for Istanbul: 2200
- Prepare for Berlin: None
- Shelve indefinitely: 1283, 1706


### **Account versioning cluster**

Link to previous Core Dev gathering presentation on account versioning: https://git.that.world/talks/20190417-account-versioning.git/plain/presentation.pdf

#### Key benefits: 
Versioning enables eWASM to coexist with EVM in one block and makes future EVM upgrades safer. Included in the account versioning group is the EVM upgrade (615) that enables static jumps, which enable strong formal analysis of contracts

#### Relation to Previous Hardfork postmortem
For Istanbul, we have some EIPs that propose to decrease operation costs. As part of the last hard fork postmortem, one of the main reason the re-entry bug happened is because EIP-1283 was the first to-be-on-mainnet EIP that includes gas cost decrement. Later in the discussion, it's generally agreed that if we ever want to do another gas/operation cost decrement, we'd either need extra assessment, or it needs to be combined with account versioning.

As a result, account versioning EIPs affect a larger portion of Istanbul EIPs than what's listed above.

#### Relevant EIPs:
- [1702 Generalized Account Versioning Scheme](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1702) (Wei Tang)
- [1707 Use Version Byte Prefix for Contract Account Versioning](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1707) (Wei Tang)
- [1712 Disallow Deployment of Unused Opcodes](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1712) (Wei Tang)
- [1891 Contract-based Account Versioning](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1891) (Wei Tang)
- [615 Subroutines and Static Jumps for the EVM](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-615) (Greg Colvin, Brooklyn Zelenka, Paweł Bylica, Christian Reitwiessner)
- [663 Unlimited SWAP and DUP instructions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-663) (Alex Beregszaszi)

#### Key concepts:
Versioning:
- EVM versions allow older (dynamic jumping contracts) and newer (static jumping contracts) to co-exist.
- EVM versions allow eWASM contracts and EVM contracts to co-exist within one block.
- EVM versions allow EVM upgrades to guarantee that the behaviour of [older contracts is better preserved](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/immutables-invariants-and-upgradability/2440/30)
- See presentation on versioning [here](https://git.that.world/talks/20190417-account-versioning.git/plain/presentation.pdf)

EVM upgrade to enable static jumps:
- Dynamic jumps are [hugely problematic](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-615-subroutines-and-static-jumps-for-the-evm/2728/25) for contract analysis (control-flow, data-flow, static and formal) and are going to eventually be deprecated. This will be achieved by first by introducing static jumps and subroutines then by later discouraging dynamic jumps entirely. Static jumps significantly lower the bar for static analysis during [formal verification of smart contracts](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-615-subroutines-and-static-jumps-for-the-evm/2728/58)
- Static jumps are introduced by moving the frame pointer/returner to new stack and by treating subroutines arguments as local variables
- A dynamic jump is theoretically slower because takes a binary search of a table of every JUMPDEST in the program O(log n) vs O(1) for static jumps, however no testing has confirmed a realised speed gain.
- Static jumps and subroutines are introduced in a single EIP (rather than multiple EIPs) to harness the momentum and get the change implemented, rather than first implementing subroutines (composed of dynamic jumps) then static jumps in a separate fork. The individual components (if split into mulptiple EIPs) [are mostly useless in isolation](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-615-subroutines-and-static-jumps-for-the-evm/2728/56)
- 615 [has an implementation](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf1660d6bec22299e6fa254) for ethereum client devs to model their implementations on.
- While there are ten new opcodes introduced by 615, each opcode is [mapped](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-615-subroutines-and-static-jumps-for-the-evm/2728/44) to a similar functional element in eWASM.

#### EIP interactions
- 615 requires one of the account versioning proposals to go ahead (1702, 1707/1217 or 1891)
- 663 can coexist with 615, as discussed by [Greg](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5d085a3ed1b1df620d1937be). Previous opinion was that 663 is [made redundant](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/663#issuecomment-318838695) by 615 through the use of [PUTLOCAL and GETLOCAL](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-615-subroutines-and-static-jumps-for-the-evm/2728/33). It was also thought initially that it would [break safety guarantees](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf7f34bf31ba302588e445a) if co-implemented with 615, though not the case, as long as 663 is not 'unlimited', but limited ot the stack frame.


Three account versioning proposals, only one must be selected
- **1702 (preferred)**. The EIP has two variants, with the second variant being preferred (In the EIP see under Specification -> Contract Deployment -> [Alternative Design](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1702))
- 1707 + 1712 (likely not for istanbul). Version as RLP item based on code header prefix. Possibly backward incompatible.
- 1891 (likely not for Istanbul). Store version in a dedicated contract, and [use new opcodes VCREATE/VCREATE2 to get version](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1891/files). Compared to other two solutions will have worse performance (extra to call to state trie), but is less complex and benefits by: 1) Allowing account state format to stay the same, 2) allowing precompile invocation to stay the same and 3) by preventing forging of version bytes.

**1702 flavours: 1 with-optional-code-prefix (Preferred) and 2 with-compulsory-code-prefix (not preferred)**
- Design 1: A contract can only deploy subcontract with the same version.Requires either only allowing deploying "newest" version, or achange in RLP structure in contract creation transactions.
- Design 1 variant makes contract deployment transaction deploys a contract family, and only allow newest account version to be deployed at root. Once we deploy newer versions (like eWASM), older versions (like EVM) should not be able to be deployed again. This is just architecturally simple. EIP-1702 author Wei Tang slightly prefers this, and the 615 team is okay with this design (as per ACD call #63 1hr6mins).
- Design 2: All version that is not zero requires a code prefix (such as\0asm). It can be variable length, but must be unique.
- Design 2 variant allows all versions to be deployed, but it requires contract header prefix for all subsequent account versions. This variant [was previously preferred](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf6733c82e5c67322287ece) by the 615 team and had [support](https://gitter.im/ethereum/AllCoreDevs?at=5cf68498f3a60a79a451a78b). However in subsequent discussion between Wei and Greg, Design 1 was decided to be preferred.

#### Account Versioning Cluster Outcome
- Prepare for Istanbul: None
- Prepare for Berlin: 663 and 1702 (Design-#1).
- Shelve indefinitely: 615, 1891, 1707 and 1712.


### **Storage gas cost cluster**

#### Key benefits:
Some opcodes are mispriced, and by repricing them more transations could fit into blocks.
A separate new counter that counts gas with more granularity prepares clients for how eWASM contracts meter gas.

#### Relevant EIPs:
- [1884 Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1884) (Martin Holst Swende)
- [2035 Stateless Clients - Repricing SLOAD and SSTORE to pay for block proofs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2035) (Alexey Akhunov)
- [2045 add EIP for fractional gas costs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2045) (Casey Detrio)

#### Key concepts
**Match gas cost with CPU-time cost**: Current gas costs do not reflect the true CPU cost of operations. In particular, SLOAD and BALANCE are overpriced. 1884 Increases SLOAD and BALANCE gas costs, to properly reflect real relative CPU-time cost. A new opcode SELFBALANCE is also introduced.

**Increase throughput without state bloat**: To increase transaction throughput the price of computation opcodes (e.g ADD, SUB, MUL etc.) could be decreased by up to a factor of 10. The EIP leaves the gas cost of other opcodes the same (e.g those that affect the state size such as SSTORE, CREATE). To lower the cost of these computational opcodes, which are already priced close to 1 (the minimum possible value), the idea is to allow fractions of gas. 2045 introduces a new gas counter `particles` which is an optional feature that some developers may chose to use when hunting for more optimised contracts. Optimisations in [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone) could be implemented in Geth and Parity to reduce the real CPU time for these opcodes, allowing for [the benchmarked](https://github.com/ewasm/benchmarking#evm-benchmarks-2019-05-23) ~10x reduction in some gas costs.

#### EIP interactions
Other EIPs that affect storage gas costs might be:
- 2035 Part of the **state rent** roadmap, also increases SLOAD in order to allow better block proof transmission. 

#### Key questions
- Can geth and parity implement the evmone optimisations?
- What are the real costs of the computational opcodes in Geth and Parity after optimisations?
- What precise values should 2045 have for each computational opcode (ADD, SUB, MUL..), post-optimisations?

#### Storage Gas Cost Cluster Outcome
- Prepare for Istanbul: 1884
- Prepare for Berlin: 2045
- Shelve indefinitely: 2035

### **Chain metadata cluster**

#### Relevant EIPs:
- [1965 Method to check if a chainID is valid at a specific block number](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1965) (Ronan Sandford)
- [1959 New Opcode to check if a chainID is part of the history of chainIDs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1959) (Ronan Sandford)
- [1344 ChainID opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1344) (Richard Meissner, Bryant Eisenbach)
- [2014 Extended State Oracle](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2014) (Alex Beregszaszi)

#### Key concepts:
1965 Adds a precompile to get the ChainID at a specific block number. This supercedes 1959, which introduces ChainID as a new opcode, but likely has reduced fork freedom.

1344 introduces ChainID via an opcode. Could theoretically co-exist with 1965, but provides similar functionality. Safe from replay vulnerabilities, but has additional considerations (as noted in the EIP rationale). There may be some utility in using both 1344 and 1965 at the time of a hard fork to allow transactions to traverse the fork more cleanly, as discussed in the [forum](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-1344-add-chain-id-opcode/1131/92)

2014 Introduces an extensible contract system to bring more data to smart contracts, including block hashes and chain identifiers, using the contract ABI encoding. Might be used with 1965 or 1959 to check the validity of the chain identifier for a block. There are concerns in the EIP discussion [thred](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-2014-extended-state-oracle/3301/5) that including a method for chain ID in this EIP is complex and not wise.

#### Key Questions
- Should 2014 be modified to exclude the method for ChainID?
- Is there anyone who thinks that 1344 is not needed, given that 1965 is going ahead? 

#### Chain Metadata Cluster Outcome
- Prepare for Istanbul: 1344
- Prepare for Berlin: None
- Shelve indefinitely: 1959, 1965 and 2014.

### **State rent cluster**

#### Key benefits
Maintain present-day ethereum by making optimisations that keep state size small

#### Key concepts:

State rent proposal is planned as a [gradual upgrade](https://medium.com/@akhounov/state-rent-changes-for-the-next-ethereum-hard-fork-f68a826558c5) over multiple hard forks. Proposals by Alexey Akhunov.

Planned prototyping and implementation, in order of decreasing priority:
- Change C: Net contract size accounting, [2027](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2027). Also useful for snapshot sync and better pricing for SLOADs
- Changes A & B: State counters contract [2029](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2029) & net transaction counter [2031](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2031)
- Change H: Fixed rent prepayments [2026](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2026)
- Stateless clients: Repricing SLOAD and SSTORE to pay for block proofs [2035](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2035) (See also **storage gas cost** cluster above)

#### State Rent Cluster Outcome
- Prepare for Istanbul: None
- Prepare for Berlin: None
- Shelve indefinitely (until ready): 2035, 2026, 2027, 2029 and 2031 

# Post-Istanbul

The next fork will be called [Muir Glacier](/roadmap/muir_glacier.md) and will address the difficulty bomb.
