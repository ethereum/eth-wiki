<!-- SUBTITLE: The EIP-1283 Deactivation that is being applied at the same time as Constantinople Feb 25th, 2019 -->

Petersburg is the "fix" that is being applied on top of [Constantinople](/roadmap#constantinople). It removes [EIP-1283](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283), and it is being applied / deployed at the same time as the February 25th, 2019 Constantinople work.

Roughly, Constantinople activates the new EIPs including 1283, and then Petersburg immediately de-activates 1283.
