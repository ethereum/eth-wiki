# Sharding roadmap

The roadmap is an active area of research. The outline below is only intended to provide flavour, with more details in specifications (which have been released for phases 0 and 1 as of 14 Dec 2018, as linked to below). It is intended for this document to be maintained with ongoing R&D.

Sourced originally from the now [retired spec for phase 1 sharding](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec-retired/1407), with modifications.

## Ethereum 2.0
### Phase 0: PoS beacon chain without shards
   * PoS beacon chain using Casper FFG for finality
   * Validators create an RNG via RANDAO in block proposals
   * Validators organize into proposers and attestation committees from the output of the RNG
   * Validators create crosslinks for stubbed shards
   * See the [phase 0 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/0_beacon-chain.md) FMI.

### Phase 1: Basic sharding without EVM
   * Blobs (Binary Large Objects) are collated in shards without transactions (which require execution)
   * Proposers submit blobs
   * Notaries
   * For more details, see the [phase 1 spec](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/master/specs/core/1_shard-data-chains.md) and [implementations](/sharding/sharding-introduction-r-d-compendium.md#implementations).

### Phase 2: EVM state transition function
   - Full nodes only
   - Asynchronous cross-contract calls only
-   [Account abstraction](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-101.md)
-   [eWASM](https://github.com/ewasm/design)
-   Archive accumulators: <https://ethresear.ch/t/history-state-and-asynchronous-accumulators-in-the-stateless-model/287> and <https://ethresear.ch/t/batching-and-cyclic-partitioning-of-logs/536> and <https://ethresear.ch/t/double-batched-merkle-log-accumulator/571>
-   Storage rent: [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-and-principled-way-to-compute-rent-fees/1455) and [here](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=storage%20rent).
-   [Bandwidth fees](https://ethresear.ch/t/incentivizing-a-robust-p2p-network-relay-layer/1438)

### Phase 3: Light client state protocol

-   Executors
-   [State-minimized clients](https://ethresear.ch/t/state-minimised-executions/748). [Stateless clients](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172) are not ideal as we don't want to offload all storage into secondary markets, rather we can give people a choice to pay storage rent on the blockchain or pay for it in secondary markets.

### Phase 4: Cross-shard transactions: see [here](http://notes.ethereum.org/s/BJc_eGVFM#cross-shard-communication) and [more](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=cross-shard).

-   Internally-synchronous zones: [mind map including architectures](https://www.mindomo.com/zh/mindmap/sharding-d7cf8b6dee714d01a77388cb5d9d2a01)
-   See also e.g. <https://ethresear.ch/t/synchronous-cross-shard-transactions-with-consolidated-concurrency-control-and-consensus-or-how-i-rediscovered-chain-fibers/2318/5>

### Phase 5: Tight coupling with main chain security: [here](https://hackmd.io/s/HJ_BbgCFz#%E2%9F%A0-1600---1645--Ethereum-20-End-game) and [more](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=tight%20coupling).

-   Data availability proofs: [A note on data availability and erasure coding](https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding), <https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-and-data-forgetfulness/61>, 
-   [Casper](/concepts/casper-proof-of-stake-compendium.md) integration.
-   [Internally fork-free sharding](https://ethresear.ch/search?q=internally%20fork-free)
-   Manager shard

### Phase 6: Super-quadratic or exponential sharding

-   Recursively, shards within shards within shards...
-   Load balancing: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)), [search results](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=load+balancing&t=canonical&ia=web). Related: <https://ethresear.ch/t/history-state-and-asynchronous-accumulators-in-the-stateless-model/287>, <https://ethresear.ch/t/state-minimized-implementation-on-current-evm/1255>
