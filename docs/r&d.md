<!-- TITLE: R&D -->



A broad introduction to and overview of Ethereum research is available at [Ethereum 2 and alternative PoS implementations](https://ethresear.ch/t/ethereum-2-and-alternative-pos-implementations/190/7), however this is now somewhat outdated.

### Sharding
Sharding introductory information is available [here](Sharding-introduction-R&D-compendium).

### Ethereum research communication channels
* [Ethereum research Discourse forum](https://ethresear.ch/). An introduction to the site is [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/read-this-before-posting/8), which includes onboarding packets for potential collaborators with generic research and programming language theory;
* [Ethereum research repo](https://github.com/ethereum/research); and 
* [Ethereum research gitter Channel](https://gitter.im/ethereum/research).

Many research topics are related to improving scalability, but other research topics and categories are available at the [Ethereum research Discourse forum](https://ethresear.ch/), and there are others that improve scalability but also improve other properties, e.g. security, decentralization, and transparency.
