# Decentralized Apps (Dapps)

<!-- TODO: Formatting in this doc is horrible -->

[![Documentation chat](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-Docs%20chat-4AB495.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/documentation)

Any good, service, governance or economic activity can be decentralized and tokenized with and transacted via Ethereum. The token represents the dapp (an abbreviation for decentralized app) while it uses the Ethereum blockchain, but the price of the token is different. Activity that has any economic or governance aspect, conceived or as of yet unconceived, can be done via Ethereum, provided that the right code is written and the necessary hardware or other required things are used (such as computers running an Ethereum node, and in some special cases, a measurement device to measure a resource flow for additional verification/auditable purposes, like a meter for electricity ⚡🔌, water 🚰 or gas 🔥; or a waste 🗑️ volume detector). 

<!--I don't really like this term as with R&D plans, the intention is to make the core protocol lighter, abstracting as much as possible, e.g. execution and accounts. Additionally it is mostly speculation and I haven't seen evidence that the market cap of Ethereum grows faster than the market cap of applications. The platform aspect of Ethereum has been referred to as a 'fat protocol' <a href="http://www.usv.com/blog/fat-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, as opposed to the 'thin protocols' of Web 1.0 and 2.0 with HTTP, SMTP, etc., with the take home point (in bold) being:
<blockquote><strong>the market cap of the protocol always</strong> <strong>grows faster than the combined value of the applications built on top, since the success of the application layer drives further speculation at the protocol layer.</strong></blockquote>-->

One kind of application that is particularly intriguing is decentralized autonomous organisations (**DAOs**); this includes entities as large as, or even larger than nation-states 🇦🇺🇺🇸🇮🇳🇬🇧🇨🇳🇧🇷🇷🇺🇯🇵, social networks, multinational public companies, etc.). Note that having complete autonomy is probably not a good idea, since code may not be able to handle new issues that arise, so human intervention should probably always be an option, but preferably in the hands of a small, non-profit entity or some decentralized solution (perhaps similar to the <a href="https://aragon.one/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aragon Network</a>). See [governance](./governance-compendium.md) for more info. By analogy, you wouldn't want a nuclear power plant to be completely automated with no possible means of human intervention. As a precaution, you'd want several safeguards including, for example, an off button. 😉 As explained in this Ethereum Wiki <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, the first DAO, known as The DAO, resulted in many funds being stolen, and Ethereum hard forking into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.

## List

The following list is sourced from [Coin Market Cap tokens (you can sort by market cap)](https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/) and <a href="https://dapps.ethercasts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of the Dapps</a>, both of which lists many more, as well as elsewhere, e.g. Gitter research room chats. ([Dapp Insight](https://dappinsight.com) was added later but in addition to State of the Dapps, gives stats on live dapps.) (There are 854 dapps on State of the Dapps as of Dec 1 2017; then [909 on Jan 1 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20180101114436/https://www.stateofthedapps.com/). 😯 You can search by tags.) Other examples are also presented e.g. on day 4 of [Devcon 3](http://www.ryanyosua.me/devcon-3-talks/), as well as outlined in the Ethereum whitepaper in the <a href="https://ethereum.org/whitepaper#a-next-generation-smart-contract-and-decentralized-application-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction</a> and <a href="https://ethereum.org/whitepaper#applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applications section</a>. Note also that while most of the dapps in the following list run on the Ethereum platform, some examples do not, and where they don't run on Ethereum, it is generally noted as what they do run on. This is not a big deal, as any dapp could theoretically run on another blockchain, (or indirectly via inter-blockchains like Cosmos or Polkadot) provided that the host blockchain has the required features. Also note that the below list is not an endorsement, and is not exhaustive or necessarily well-maintained. At worst, it's included because it was briefly looked into and it seemed like a good idea, while more time may have been spent doing due diligence on some ideas and can therefore have a better idea of its usefulness. Dapps that have been implemented, or are under development, or have been publicly conceptualised, includes:

Examples of<strong> local electricity trading</strong> include: <a href="https://gridplus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid+</a>, <a href="http://lo3energy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LO3</a>/<a href="http://lo3energy.com/transactive-grid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transactive Grid</a>, <a href="https://powerledger.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Power Ledger</a>, <a href="http://www.nexergy.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexergy</a>, <a href="https://localvolts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Local Volts</a> and <a href="https://divvi.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divvi</a>. Grid+ uses Ethereum and <a href="https://github.com/gridplus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they have open source code</a>. Power Ledger has closed source code and runs on the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, rather than the public Ethereum blockchain. <a href="https://twitter.com/PowerLedger_io/status/916792824623923201" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They had a token sale in early October</a>. Both Power Ledger and Grid+ also detail more unique applications in their pipeline, such as renewable energy asset generation (Power Ledger) and Grid+'s in-home computer, an "intelligent agent" that pays for a customers electricity in real-time, using stable tokens, stores cryptocurrency like the hardware wallet functions of Ledger and Trezor; providing Casper proof-of-stake signing, and provide an Ethereum API for IoT ([pp. 26 and 34-36, white paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz90riPGRHquNDVXVE81RmppaUk/view)). <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2079334-blockchain-based-microgrid-gives-power-to-consumers-in-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transactive Grid uses Ethereum</a> and it has been rolled out in <a href="http://brooklynmicrogrid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn with a microgrid</a>, however LO3 hasn't released any code or details for its Transactive Grid application. The others are still all under development (as of August 2017), and they have been scant on the details of how they would implement their application, at the least not releasing their code. Divvi say on its website that they will use the blockchain. Local Volts and Nexergy do not.

-   electricity tokenization: e.g. <a href="https://solarcoin.org/en/front-page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SolarCoin</a>, <a href="https://energycoin.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EnergyCoin</a>, although both are altcoins rather than Ethereum tokens;
-   governance of any organisation, e.g. <a href="http://Democracy.Earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy.Earth</a>; and also governance of DAOs, e.g. <a href="https://aragon.one/network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aragon</a>. There's also [Holographic consensus](https://medium.com/daostack/decentralized-governance-first-principles-1fc6eaa492ed) and a [Gitter channel for governance in Eth](https://gitter.im/ethereum/governance);

Read more on that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/02/07/the-first-government-to-secure-land-titles-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-expands-project/#11558e984dcd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>: "Having so far built the software and tested it with a couple dozen land title registrations, Bitfury and the Georgian National Agency of Public Registry have now signed a new memorandum of understanding to expand the service to purchases and sales of land titles, registration of new land titles, demolition of property, mortgages and rentals, as well as notary services". Nottar.io also provides notary services. A similar, more specific application is for academic certificates with [Smart Diploma](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps/smart-diploma);
-   Debit card 💳 transactions 🤝 (done on several exchanges 💱, e.g. <a href="https://www.coinjar.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinjar Swipe</a> (but it accepts BTC only), Coinbase, while others which I've mentioned elsewhere in this article have plans to do this e.g. [OmiseGO](https://www.omise.co/go);
-   co-ownership of real assets e.g. the [Swarm Fund](https://invest.swarm.fund/r/GCADJ7GTOVMT7UBG7WY4GB44UMG42IEXR2FUK4GLFWZESFPY65SEIPWN)
-   crowdsales, e.g. an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_coin_offering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a> as compared with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intial Public Offering (IPO)</a>, or for tokens with Ethereum: an Initial Token Offering (ITO). Note that this is not so much a business model in itself, per se, rather it is more of a fundraising method (which has also led to scams, e.g. <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/j5j34x/ethereum-startup-confido-vanished-after-people-invested-374k-ico" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>);
-   crowdfunding platforms such as [Acorn Collective](https://aco.ai/);
-   crowd development (but not as part of the blockchain, e.g. <a href="http://developmentcrowd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>), e.g. for infrastructure and other public assets;
-   think of public companies being remodelled into communities with tokens instead of shares, governance using a platform like <a href="http://Democracy.Earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democracy.Earth</a> (which can be tailored to have voting anywhere between one vote one person like direct democracy, or conventionally more hierarchical like a board of directors and token-holders instead of or in addition to—and probably eventually superceding—shareholders);

-   trust-based models like the [Trustlines Network](http://trustlines.network/)
-   Secure distributed computing, e.g. <a href="https://golem.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Golem</a>. Ethereum needs to be faster e.g. with <a href="https://github.com/ewasm/design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EWASM</a> and parallelizability.
-   accountability, e.g. for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitgive-addresses-non-profit-accountability-bitcoin-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-profits</a> (e.g. "how do I know how badly you need a donation unless I can see your net liabilities, net assets, and balance sheet, and how you plan to use the funds?") and <a href="https://www.ethnews.com/united-nations-world-food-programme-uses-ethereum-to-aid-syrian-refugees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aid</a> (also see <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-blockchain-used-by-united-nations-for-sending-aid-to-syria" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>)

Makes use of the [NotaryProxy](https://github.com/dAppBridge/NotaryProxy) service to ensure all data can be validated, audited and traced back to source.
-   [CoinMirror](https://www.coinmirror.co), an investment platform, that allows users to co-invest with credible ICO investors, in order to manage risk and provide access to deals at the earliest possible stages. The smart contracts automatically mirror the actions of the syndicate lead for every backer and offers end-to-end processing (backing, buying, selling, returning profits).
-   supply chains, e.g. for [sugar](https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-government-awards-grant-to-blockchain-project-for-sustainable-sugar);

Examples that have been conceptualized, but not implemented (at least as far as the creator of this wiki is aware of) include:

-   reducing transaction costs for existing business models (<a href="https://bravenewcoin.com/news/tokenize-the-enterprise-and-melt-it-into-the-community-rinse-repeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> is a good read about that). However, to tokenize online centric business models, the network model should change from client-server to peer-to-peer, to avoid a conflict of interest. This is more difficult to achieve since a server is a piece of infrastructure, and transferring to a peer-to-peer model would cause it to be a sunk cost. Additionally, it may be difficult to build a replacement dapp for a successful website, because it is hard to get a network of engaged users to change to using something else (inertia). Centralized web apps  (not just mobile apps but websites, and use the word to contrast with dapps) include:
-   Google (although note [Weipoint](https://www.weipoint.com/) as mentioned previously),
-   social networks like [Facebook](http://www.trustnodes.com/2018/01/04/zuckerberg-studying-cryptocurrency-implementation-facebook), Twitter, (although note [Akasha](https://akasha.world/) above, while [Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will look into cryptocurrencies](https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104380170714571);
-   online marketplaces e.g. Amazon, eBay and Alibaba (decentralized alternatives include [OpenBazaar](https://www.openbazaar.org/) for goods and bnbs; [Soma](https://soma.co/) for products or services, [Canya for services](https://canya.io/) also note this simple implementation and subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethmarket/), as well as more specific or niche marketplaces like [Cryptokitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/), [Hamster](https://hmstr.io/)). For more info see [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/10/24/whats-the-future-of-online-marketplaces-blockchains-technology-impact/#3f6bde2a63a0)
-   making economically viable other business models that have seen low uptake or aren't economically viable without blockchain tech. So-called sharing economy business models (which are more aptly called tasker or rentier capitalism models) like Airbnb, Uber, AirTasker, Fiverr, Upwork, TaskRabbit, and Menulog are particularly ripe for transformation (the term transformation is preferrable to disruption, since it should be a net positive change, while negative effects are manageable or solvable), since no trusted third party for a transaction is needed, such as banks 🏦, credit card 💳 companies or PayPal, just a smart contract; and

Note that the Basic Attention Token has already been mentioned, and the creator of this wiki is skeptical that AI will create truly beautiful art, since no AI can have any feeling. <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoKitties</a> is an example of meme trading and has taken up [a lot of the transactions on the Ethereum network](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d).

Other ideas include plus generally thinking of existing business models running on the blockchain, like real estate developers and investment trusts (with which blockchains could be used e.g. for crowdfunding). 
-   legally enforceable wills running on the blockchain, as well as being able to appoint an executor in a legally enforceable way on the blockchain.

More examples are e.g. [here in a blog post](https://medium.com/@Ethereum_AI/ethereum-introduction-what-exactly-is-it-why-care-how-to-invest-9a627ab04408).

[Here is a list of noteworthy dapps as listed on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#Applications), those not already mentioned above include (do not add to this list anything that is not on the linked Wikipedia article list):

-   [Slock.It](https://slock.it/) smart locks;
-   Digital tokens pegged to gold, e.g. [Digix](https://digix.global/);
-   [Everex](https://www.everex.io/), a blockchain-powered financial service platform;

Here's a challenge: keep an eye out for activity that has not been implemented on Ethereum (or could be implemented in a better way; check this article and research to check whether it's implemented and if so, how well) and then:

-   develop a dapp for the idea yourself (after learning <a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Solidity</a>, if you don't already know it); or
-   Open-source the idea.
