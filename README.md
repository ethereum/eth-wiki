# Eth.wiki

:no_entry_sign: **no longer actively maintained** :no_entry_sign:

Eth.wiki is a now largely outdated collection of resources explaining the state-of-the-art in Ethereum circa 2020.

The material in this repository has been updated and migrated to ethereum.org.

This repository is due to be archived shortly. Please visit ethereum.org instead for current Ethereum information!
