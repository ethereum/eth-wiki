<!-- TITLE: CC0 license -->



[(Verbatim from the home page.)](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki#license-and-contributor-license-agreement)

Please permit your contributions to be under the CC0 license,  which makes your contributions have no rights reserved, putting them in the public domain. This will help to allow for the dissemination of information about Ethereum, the Ethereum ecosystem and Web 3 to the public, in a completely permissive manner. To state that you accept your contributions to be under a CC0 license, please add yourself to the list of external contributors [here](http://wikijs.ethereum.wiki/CC0-license#list-of-contributors). Otherwise, without adding yourself to the list, your contributions will be all rights reserved. Some previous contributions may have all rights reserved (by contributors that have not agreed to a CC0 license [at pull request 528](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/pull/528)), since no copyright permission was stated explicitly. Until all previous contributors agree to a CC0 license, and to provide clarity of licensing, you may also wish to add a HTML comment to the top of pages or sections that you contribute to, like so: `<!--*Name Surname*, Github username, **email@domain** and/or other contact methods-->`. 

***
#### External Contributor example
- *Name Surname*, Github username, **email@domain** and/or other contact methods. 

(An email or other contact methods are optional, but preferred in case you have set a no-reply public Github email address, or if your Github account is deleted. However, to prevent spam and too many emails, you may prefer to list public contact methods such as your Twitter username and your website.)
